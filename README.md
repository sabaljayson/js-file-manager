# html5-file-manager

File manager with web UI. Intended as a replacement for native file manager,
rather than as a UI to browse files on remote server.

## How to run
Assuming you have imagemagick installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/tsim0/js-file-manager.git
cd js-file-manager
npm install
npm start
```
Node.js server will be launched, and <http://localhost:3000> will open up in your default browser.
